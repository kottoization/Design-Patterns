# Design-Patterns
Different design patterns in different branches, inplemented in C# <br><br>
Most of the files are in .rar or .zip and they are ment to show basic understandment of those patterns. <br> 
I have wanted to show only the basic understandment, so in most cases the program's operation is limited only to this area. <br><br>
ðŸŽ“ All the files are either based on a course (udemy.com/course/design-patterns-csharp-dotnet) or are coming from my academic work.

# Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.<br>
It's like a blueprint for creating groups of objects with common characteristics. This pattern allows for the creation of different sets of objects that work together seamlessly,<br>
ensuring compatibility and cohesion. It's particularly useful in scenarios where multiple families of objects need to be created, and the system needs to be flexible enough to accommodate changes in these families.
