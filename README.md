# Design-Patterns
Different design patterns in different branches, inplemented in C# <br><br>
Most of the files are in .rar or .zip and they are ment to show basic understandment of those patterns. <br> 
I have wanted to show only the basic understandment, so in most cases the program's operation is limited only to this area. <br><br>

# Asynchronous Initialization Pattern

The Asynchronous Initialization Pattern allows resources or components to be initialized in a non-blocking manner, avoiding delays in the main execution flow. This pattern is similar to setting up a background task to prepare necessary resources while the program continues with other tasks.

This pattern is often used in conjunction with Dependency Injection, allowing for the asynchronous creation and injection of dependencies. By doing so, the application can remain responsive and efficient, even during resource-intensive setup processes. This enhances user experience and ensures that the program remains interactive throughout the initialization phase.
