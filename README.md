# Design-Patterns
Different design patterns in different branches, inplemented in C# <br><br>
Most of the files are in .rar or .zip and they are ment to show basic understandment of those patterns. <br> 
I have wanted to show only the basic understandment, so in most cases the program's operation is limited only to this area. <br>

# Producer-Consumer Pattern

The Producer-Consumer Pattern is a design pattern that facilitates the efficient exchange of data between two entities: the producer, responsible for generating data, and the consumer, tasked with processing it. This pattern is akin to a conveyor belt system in a factory, where one entity continuously produces items and another entity consumes them for further processing. It ensures smooth coordination and synchronization between producers and consumers, optimizing resource utilization and preventing potential bottlenecks in the system.
