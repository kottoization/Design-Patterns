# Design-Patterns
Different design patterns in different branches, inplemented in C# <br><br>
All files are in .rar or .zip and they are ment to show basic understandment of those patterns. <br>
One of the projects updated for each patter is also extracted form rar and uploaded as pure cs files.
# State Pattern
The State Pattern is a design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior based on its current state.<br> It does this by separating each state's behavior into a separate class and having the object delegate to the appropriate state class.This makes it easier to manage complex logic and state transitions. Imagine having a robot that can change its behavior depending on whether it's happy or sad. The State Pattern allows the robot to switch between happy and sad states, and change its behavior accordingly, without changing the robot's overall programming.
