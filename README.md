# Monostate Pattern

The Monostate Pattern, also known as the Borg Pattern, is a design pattern that allows multiple instances of a class to share the same state. Unlike the traditional Singleton Pattern, where only one instance exists, the Monostate Pattern ensures that all instances have synchronized data. It's akin to a group of individuals who share a collective memory, allowing them to operate with a unified understanding of their environment. This pattern provides flexibility while maintaining a consistent state across all instances, making it a powerful tool for scenarios requiring synchronized behavior.
