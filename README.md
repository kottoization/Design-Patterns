# Design-Patterns
Different design patterns in different branches, inplemented in C# <br><br>
Most of the files are in .rar or .zip and they are ment to show basic understandment of those patterns. <br> 
I have wanted to show only the basic understandment, so in most cases the program's operation is limited only to this area. <br>

# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance throughout the entire application. This pattern is akin to having a unique key that unlocks access to a specific resource, ensuring that there is a single point of access to the class instance. It is particularly useful when one instance is sufficient to coordinate actions across the system, such as managing configuration settings or maintaining a connection pool. The Singleton Pattern promotes efficient resource usage and global access, making it a valuable tool in software design.
