# Design-Patterns
Different design patterns in different branches, inplemented in C# <br><br>
Most of the files are in .rar or .zip and they are ment to show basic understandment of those patterns. <br> 
I have wanted to show only the basic understandment, so in most cases the program's operation is limited only to this area. <br>

# Composite Pattern 
The Composite Pattern is a design pattern that helps you build tree-like structures by grouping objects into a whole hierarchy. This lets you treat individual objects and groups of objects in the same way.It's like putting different building blocks together to form a bigger structure, and then treating that structure as if it were a single block.
