# Design-Patterns
Different design patterns in different branches, inplemented in C# <br><br>
Most of the files are in .rar or .zip and they are ment to show basic understandment of those patterns. <br> 
I have wanted to show only the basic understandment, so in most cases the program's operation is limited only to this area. <br><br>
ðŸŽ“ All the files are either based on a course (udemy.com/course/design-patterns-csharp-dotnet) or are coming from my academic work.

# Simple Factory Pattern

The Simple Factory Pattern is a design pattern that centralizes the creation of objects by providing a dedicated class or method responsible for instantiating objects based on certain conditions.<br>
It acts as a simple factory that produces different types of objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.<br>
This pattern is like a specialized assembly line that churns out various products based on specific orders. It enhances code modularity and flexibility, making it easier to adapt to changes in object creation requirements.
