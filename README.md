# Design-Patterns
Different design patterns in different branches, inplemented in C# <br><br>
All files are in .rar or .zip and they are ment to show basic understandment of those patterns. <br>
One of the projects updated for each patter is also extracted form rar and uploaded as pure cs files.

# Producer-Consumer Pattern

The Producer-Consumer Pattern is a design pattern that facilitates the efficient exchange of data between two entities: the producer, responsible for generating data, and the consumer, tasked with processing it. This pattern is akin to a conveyor belt system in a factory, where one entity continuously produces items and another entity consumes them for further processing. It ensures smooth coordination and synchronization between producers and consumers, optimizing resource utilization and preventing potential bottlenecks in the system.
